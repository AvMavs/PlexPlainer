# Plex-Explainer
What exactly is this Plex thing your techie friends keep rambling about? Here's everything you need.

So, your friend is into technology a lot, and assumingly, PCs and internet. And they sent you this invite to their "Plex Server", which they want you to join. Is it safe? Are they going to hack you? Or are they reaching out with a friendly initiative, that allows them to share media?

# What is Plex?
Plex Media Server is the tool made by the company Plex (https://www.plex.tv/). There are other alternatives, like Emby, Kody and Jellyfin, also based on the same concept. I'll try to explain the concept in a simple way.

# Simple
In the simplest words, Plex allows you, (or your acquaintance), to make your own streaming service. A streaming service is something like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, HBO Max, Apple TV+, Paramount+ etc. You get what I mean? There are so many! Even YouTube is a streaming service. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

With Plex, you can make a streaming service out of the content you have on YOUR computer. Any family videos, or any pet videos, photos, etc. You get the idea. And if you have any movies, that too (wink).

People make Plex servers so that they can unify all the content they watch into one place. Movies and TV shows are naturally the most popular. 

So, a streaming service, as huge as the big-name brands I mentioned above run on huge servers. What is a server, you ask? It's just a bunch of really fast computers in a cold room, connected to lots of other computers. Yes, that's it. They're way faster than your home computer, though. 

When you stream off of a service, you're just playing off of one of these servers. So, you connect, via the benevelont internet, which is just a bunch of cables and computers, 
to one of these computers which stores the video which you want to watch.
